Our journey began with a standard Arduino bot kit, which provided the fundamental components such as the Arduino Uno microcontroller, basic servo motors, and chassis. While this kit laid the groundwork for our project, we needed to tailor it to meet the specific requirements of a soccer-playing robot.

A crucial aspect of the Soccer Bot's success was the design and fabrication of a custom front bracket. This component was essential for securely holding the soccer ball and ensuring reliable interactions during gameplay.
One of the standout features of our Soccer Bot is its ability to rotate 360 degrees without moving its position on the field. This functionality was achieved through careful coding and motor control.
